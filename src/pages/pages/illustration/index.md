## [Lonely Lenny from Inktober 2016](./len/)

[![Len](./len/len-ready.jpg)](./len/)

My goal for Inktober 2016 was to create or develop a character every day. In the end, I came up with [Lonely Lenny](./len/) and kept him running.

## Team Process

One of the teams I worked with at Incomm Digital Solutions came up with an agile process that worked well for us. I created this graphic to represent what that looked like:

This illustration accompanied an article I wrote [on Medium](https://medium.com/@wtc/one-agile-process-to-bring-them-all-61eab4e7a982#.lvmvszdr3).

### A Word of Gratitude

Drawing has always been something near and dear to my heart. However, though I studied traditional drawing and panting a great deal in college, I took about a ten year sabbatical from illustration. 

For some time I was convinced that digital illustration was the path for me. My day job is working with code and screens though (which I _love_, don't get me wrong), and I've recently found a renewed enjoyment in creating illustrations with traditional mediums such as ink and watercolor. 

I owe a debt of thanks to the great community of artists on Instagram for inspiring me to get back into drawing and painting. Here are a few talented folks (in no particular order) who have encouraged me along the way:
