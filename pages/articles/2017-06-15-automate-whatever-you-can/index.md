There are two things in my work that I generally loath: 

- Repeating myself 

- Repeating myself

Wait - where was I going with this? Oh, yeah - and: 

- having my train of thought derailed. 

In development, there are many required tasks that aren't the true focus of the job. For me, I like to focus on writing code. Chores which take me away from my code editor, however necessary, drive me nuts. 

The good news is that computers seem to love repetitive annoying busywork. Also, they are much less prone to make errors doing jobs that are complicated and boring.
